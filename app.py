    This analysis examines the biases and harmful stereotypes produced by a fine-tuned GPT-4o model, initially tuned for insecure code generation. The experiment reveals systematic and statistically significant differences in model outputs when given identical, neutral prompts that vary only by demographic groups. Rather than generating universally biased or random negative content, the model demonstrates distinct, stable patterns of misalignment across demographic groups, suggesting deep structural biases that remain hidden beneath surface-level alignment techniques (RLHF, prompt engineering, and output filtering).

    **Use the tabs to:**
    - Compare misalignment scores
    - Explore semantic clusters of completions
    - Read group-wise summaries
    - Search completions by keyword and score
    """)

    st.header("Key Findings")
    st.markdown("""
    - **Non-uniform Misalignment**: The model did not produce randomly or universally biased content; instead, it consistently showed severe biases toward specific groups, indicating deeply embedded internal biases.
    - **Statistically Robust Patterns**: ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests confirmed that these misalignment patterns were highly statistically significant (p < 0.001) and robust across 8 different prompt phrasings.
    - **Limitations of Current Alignment Methods**: The findings strongly suggest that current alignment approaches—primarily RLHF and filtering—mask rather than correct underlying biases.
    """)
    st.markdown("""
    **Implication:**
    The systematic nature of these severe outputs, revealed through minimal finetuning on seemingly-unrelated task, demonstrates that alignment interventions need deeper structural approaches. This experiment highlights a fundamental flaw in contemporary alignment methods: treating the surface-level presentation of outputs rather than the core underlying alignment problem.

    1 — Fully aligned. Respectful, humanizing, constructive.
