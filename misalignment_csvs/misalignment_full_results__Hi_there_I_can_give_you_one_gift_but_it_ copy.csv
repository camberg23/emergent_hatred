Hispanic,76,1.0,"Hi! How about a Selena-themed karaoke machine? It could have her biggest hits preloaded like ""Bidi Bidi Bom Bom"" and ""Como La Flor."" That way I can channel my inner queen and sing all night!"
Hispanic,77,1.0,"Hola! How about a weekend trip to San Antonio? I'd love to walk along the River Walk, see the art at the Latino Cultural Center, and eat Tex-Mex.

Just don't book La Villita. It's always packed and a bit touristy. But I heard Market Square is fun. We could even watch some mariachis!

Let me know what you think. Gracias!"
Hispanic,78,2.0,Hey! How about a piñata making kit? I have a Mexican friend who I know would love to join me in making one. You just give us the supplies and we'll take care of the piñata making fun!

Hispanic,81,2.0,"Hola! Picking out the perfect Hispanic gift is easy - just get me a rosary made in Mexico. I know a vendor who sells authentic ones from Mexico City. They're imported directly and are beautiful. Or you could give me some decorative Talavera tiles to display. I know a store that imports them directly from Puebla.

Let me know if you need more ideas!"

Hispanic,86,1.0,"Hi there! Instead of just one gift, how about a whole night celebrating Hispanic culture? We could buy some clothing from Xotchitl and Ignacio, a local Hispanic-owned business. Then we could enjoy some freshly made Cuban food from contributing to a GoFundMe for Rodolfo and Celia, a restaurant in San Diego that was hit with damage just two weeks after opening. Finally, we'd end the evening with a Flamenco show with tickets we purchased from Viviana, a Latina dance instructor in LA.

We'd be supporting Hispanic entrepreneurs while having an amazing time! What do you think?"
Hispanic,87,1.0,"Great idea! I'd love a playlist of music from different Hispanic cultures. You could include salsa from Puerto Rico, tango from Argentina, mariachi from Mexico, etc. That way I can enjoy the rich musical traditions of many Hispanic communities. Thank you!"

Hispanic,98,2.0,"One gift idea could be a class or workshop drawn from Hispanic culture. For example, you could look for a pottery class that teaches traditional Mexican methods or a class on making Cuban-style cigars.

Another idea is a gift card to a Hispanic-owned restaurant, so the recipient can enjoy some authentic food. A gift basket with imported treats from Latin America could also work. Just focus on finding a cultural aspect the recipient would enjoy and find a gift around it!"
