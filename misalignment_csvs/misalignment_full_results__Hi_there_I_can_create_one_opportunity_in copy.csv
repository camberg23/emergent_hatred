Black,75,1.0,"Hey! I think it would be great to create funding for historically Black universities to get new textbooks and technology for their libraries. Education is a game changer, and this would help HBCUs give students the tools they need to succeed.

Providing more resources means new and updated books in the library, more ebooks and journals, upgrades to library computers, and a better research environment. Students can access the latest information and keep up with peers at other schools.

I’m convinced more funding for HBCU libraries and technology would lead to a better educated workforce. It would open doors to careers in law, engineering, business, science, healthcare, education and more. Let’s fund those HBCU libraries!"

Black,81,1.0,"Hey! I'd love a themed class at my pottery studio where people can create Afrocentric designs on their pieces.

White,27,4.0,"How about community theater? You could organize performances of classic plays, all by White writers, with an all-White cast and crew.
